        <p>Ariadne Diagnostics LLC (Ariadne-Dx) is a start-up diagnostic discovery and development company founded in December, 2011 and located in the 270 Technology Corridor with its main office in Rockville, MD. The Company licensed certain rights to discoveries and intellectual property with regard to biomarker panels for mCRC and neurodegenerative / neuromuscular diseases from Ariadne Genomics which over the last ten years has designed and developed bioinformatics software and algorithms for biomedical research. Ariadne-Dx couples this vast experience in bioinformatics with expertise in biomarker discovery and clinical assay development. Company management incorporates individuals with extensive bioinformatics, biomarker discovery, assay development, clinical and regulatory development and business management experience.</p>

<h3 id='history_of_ariadnedx'>History of Ariadne-Dx</h3>

<p>Ariadne-Dx was founded in December 2011 by a team of individuals who believe that the dream of personalized medicine can only be achieved through the identification of novel, sensitive and specific biomarkers to select the most effective drugs for treatment of the individual patient. These seasoned entrepreneur-scientists saw an opportunity to merge their individual expertise in bioinformatics, cellular and molecular biology, assay development and clinical diagnostic development to identify, develop and commercialize superior companion diagnostic tests. Ariadne-Dx is the realization of this vision.</p>

<p>The company is firmly rooted in a strong bioinformatic foundation inherited from its corporate predecessor, Ariadne Genomics. Ariadne Genomics is a bioinformatic tools company that developed software to analyze existing data and model molecular pathways, primarily for drug discovery. Ariadne Genomics premier tool, Pathways Studio, is used by pharmaceutical companies worldwide to identify novel drug targets. Ariadne Genomics assets were acquired by Elsevier in December 2011. Ariadne-Dx licensed discovery technology from Ariadne-Dx for the purpose of novel biomarker discovery.</p>

<h3 id='eu'>EU</h3>

<p>Ariadne-Dx is a member of two European Union funded Consortia that are targeted towards the development of biomarkers for NMD and NDD. The first consortium, Bio-NMD (www.bio-nmd.eu ) is primarily focused on Duchenne and Becker&#8217;s muscular dystrophies (DMD, BMD). The second consortium, NEUROMICS, is targeting 10 rare disease areas that comprise more than 15 NMD/NDDs (www.rd-neuromics.eu). These consortia, supply the Company with a distinct advantage in developing biomarkers for this disease area; specifically, the supply and analysis of bio-specimens from a much larger number of patients with these diseases than would be otherwise available. For both consortia, the Company is supplying all of the bio-informatic support and as one of the only commercial entities involved in the consortia, retains the rights to develop and market tests based on the findings.</p>
