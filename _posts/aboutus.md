Ariadne Diagnostics (Ariadne Dx) is a start-up diagnostic discovery and development company founded in December 2011 and 
located in Rockville, MD. The Company is a direct spin-off of Ariadne Genomics which over the last ten years has designed 
and developed bioinformatics software and algorithms for biomedical research. Ariadne Dx couples this vast experience in 
bioinformatics and bioinformatics tool development with expertise in biomarker discovery and clinical assay development. 
Company management incorporates individuals with extensive bioinformatics, biomarker discovery, assay development, clinical 
and regulatory development and business management experience. 

### Management Team
###Ilya Mazo, Founder, Chief Executive Officer

Dr. Mazo has more than 15 years of entrepreneurial, executive and scientific leadership experience in biotech. In 2002 Mazo 
founded Ariadne Genomics to develop a bioinformatics suite of products for translational medicine, currently used at 8 out 10 
top pharma companies and thousands laboratories worldwide. This product line was acquired by Elsevier in 2011. Prior to that, 
Mazo was Scientific Project Manager at InforMax Inc. and Research Scientist at CLONTECH. He introduced several new products at 
both CLONTECH (first commercial retroviral systems) and InforMax (gene expression and proteomics software) whose revenues have 
developed into million dollar product lines. Dr. Mazo has received his PhD in Molecular Genetics from University of Illinois at 
Chicago in 1996.

###Elena Schwartz, Founder, Chief Scientific Officer

Dr. Schwartz has a broad background in cancer biology with specific training and expertise in key research areas. She has over 
19 years of research experience in disease-related biomarkers. She was involved in development of novel diagnostic tests for cancers, 
including lung, breast, ovarian and prostate. Dr. Schwartz was also actively participated in discovering, developing, and commercializing 
novel therapeutic and diagnostic products for cancer and diseases of the central nervous system. She has many publications in 
peer-reviewed journals, including single-author major review papers. Prior to her employment at Ariadne, she worked at 20/20 
GeneSystems Inc., where she helped develop a diagnostic test for the early detection of lung cancer. She also previously worked at 
Panacea Pharmaceuticals Inc., where she was intensively involved in discovery and development work in regard to Alzheimer's Disease 
and other neurodegenerative disorders. Dr. Schwartz received her PhD in Cancer Biology at the Pasteur Institute, France and Institute 
of Biochemistry, Russia. 

###Michael S. Lebowitz, Founder, Vice President of Research & Development

Dr. Lebowitz has over 22 years research experience in the biomedical sciences including 12 years involved in the development of 
cancer biomarkers for diagnostic testing. Prior to joining Ariadne Diagnostics, Dr. Lebowitz was the Director of R & D at 20/20 
GeneSystems, Inc. where he oversaw the development and launch of a blood test for the early diagnosis of lung cancer and was involved 
in platform development and biomarker discovery for several companion diagnistics tests for kidney and breast cancers, Dr. Lebowitz was 
formerly the Director of Research at Panacea Pharmaceuticals, Inc. where he was instrumental in the formation of an in-house CLIA-approved 
laboratory and the launch of three immunoassays for the early detection of cancer and one companion diagnostic; a gene expression-based 
test to predict the efficacy of a molecular-targeted therapy. He has experience working with diagnostic regulatory submissions and the FDA. 
Dr. Lebowitz was trained at Johns Hopkins University, School of Medicine where he did graduate work in biochemistry, cellular and molecular 
biology and postdoctoral work in immunopathology.
