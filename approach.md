##Science/Technology

•  Ariadne-Dx utilizes Bioinformatic tools to integrate existing data including:

–	Contextual scanning of the published literature

–	Omics data

–	Clinical Trial Data

•	The existing data is used to develop pathway models underlying clinical phenotypes

•	These models are than used to predict biomarker(s) that are likely to be indicative of the clinical phenotype

•	These models are continuously refined on the basis of new biological data
