Ariadne Diagnostics LLC (Ariadne-Dx) is a start-up diagnostic discovery and development company founded in December, 
2011 and located in the 270 Technology Corridor with its main office in Rockville, MD. The Company licensed certain 
rights to discoveries and intellectual property with regard to biomarker panels for mCRC and neurodegenerative / 
neuromuscular diseases from Ariadne Genomics which over the last ten years has designed and developed bioinformatics 
software and algorithms for biomedical research. Ariadne-Dx couples this vast experience in bioinformatics with 
expertise in biomarker discovery and clinical assay development. Company management incorporates individuals with 
extensive bioinformatics, biomarker discovery, assay development, clinical and regulatory development and business 
management experience. 

### History of Ariadne-Dx

Ariadne-Dx was founded in December 2011 by a team of individuals who believe that the dream of personalized medicine 
can only be achieved through the identification of novel, sensitive and specific biomarkers to select the most effective
drugs for treatment of the individual patient.  These seasoned entrepreneur-scientists saw an opportunity to merge their
individual expertise in bioinformatics, cellular and molecular biology, assay development and clinical diagnostic 
development to identify, develop and commercialize superior companion diagnostic tests. Ariadne-Dx is the realization 
of this vision.  

The company is firmly rooted in a strong bioinformatic foundation inherited from its corporate predecessor, Ariadne 
Genomics.  Ariadne Genomics is a bioinformatic tools company that developed software to analyze existing data and model 
molecular pathways, primarily for drug discovery.  Ariadne Genomics premier tool, Pathways Studio, is used by 
pharmaceutical companies worldwide to identify novel drug targets.  Ariadne Genomics assets were acquired by Elsevier 
in December 2011.  Ariadne-Dx licensed discovery technology from Ariadne-Dx for the purpose of novel biomarker discovery.

### How we are different for other companion diagnostics companies:

Ariadne-Dx is integrating Bio-informatics and Diagnostic Development. 

Ariadne Diagnostics, LLC (Ariadne-Dx) utilizes advanced bioinformatics tools (see Our Approach for more details) that 
integrate genomic, proteomic, cellular and clinical data to select candidate biomarkers that can predict the effects of 
drug agents on individual patients.  

The company focuses on

1. Discovery work to provide the data supporting biomarker selection; 

2. Bioinformatic studies to integrate that data for the selection of biomarkers; 

3. Biological & clinical studies to validate the utility of selected biomarkers; 

4. Assay development to support the development of clinical diagnostics 

5. Clinical validation studies for the purposes of supporting diagnostic test approvals and commercialization.

###BioMarCare Technologies Ltd. (<a href="http://www.biomarcare.com">www.biomarcare.com</a>): 

BioMarCare is dedicated to the development of a cluster of high value in-vitro diagnostics for early detection, 
prognosis and monitoring of cancer. The company's Multi-Biomarker Panel approach, combined with its technological and 
clinical expertise, promises to generate molecular and serum-based diagnostic blood tests with high specificity and 
sensitivity as well as rigorous validation, based on both novel and established cancer-specific markers. The company's 
first product, the PAR Panel™ est - for detection of disease onset/recurrence, prognosis and long-term monitoring of 
therapy, is based on Protease Activator Receptors (PARs), novel, cancer-specific serum biomarkers.  These markers are 
indicative for personalized medicine assisting in treatment selection other than or in addition to Tamoxifen therapy 
(e.g. other hormonal therapies or chemotherapy) . 

The company's second product, the Colon-MarCarePlex™ Test for early detection of colon cancer, is based on a combination
of proprietary and non proprietary RNA and DNA markers such as Colon Cancer Associated Transcript 1 (CCAT-1), a unique 
nucleic acid known to be specifically expressed in cancer cells.

BioMarCare is located at Israel's first medical research-oriented technology park, in the Jerusalem BioPark on the 
premises of Hadassah University Medical Center (HMC).  The company benefits from close proximity and easy access to the
rich infrastructure of HMC's medical campus and the Hadassah University Hospital.

BioMarCare is managed by a proven track record veteran IVD team experienced in delivering diagnostics products from idea
to commercialization. The company received a grant from the Israeli chief scientist. BioMarCare is a HBL (Hadasit 
Bio-Holdings) Portfolio Company. HBL is a publicly traded subsidiary of Hadasit Ltd (TASE: HDST)- the technology 
transfer company of the Hadassah Hospital, Jerusalem. 

###EU 

Ariadne-Dx is a member of two European Union funded Consortia that are targeted towards the development of biomarkers 
for NMD and NDD. The first consortium, Bio-NMD (<a href="http://www.bio-nmd.eu">www.bio-nmd.eu</a> ) is primarily focused on Duchenne and Becker's muscular 
dystrophies (DMD, BMD). The second consortium, NEUROMICS, is targeting 10 rare disease areas that comprise more than 15 
NMD/NDDs (<a href="http://www.rd-neuromics.eu">www.rd-neuromics.eu</a>). These consortia, supply the Company with a distinct advantage in developing biomarkers 
for this disease area; specifically, the supply and analysis of bio-specimens from a much larger number of patients with
these diseases than would be otherwise available. For both consortia, the Company is supplying all of the bio-informatic
support and as one of the only commercial entities involved in the consortia, retains the rights to develop and market 
tests based on the findings.
