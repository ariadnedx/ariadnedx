##Companion Diagnostics Tests

Internal research and development at Ariadne Dx is primarily focused on the development of companion diagnostics (CDx) for both 
cancer and neuromuscular/neurodegenerative disorders. CDx tests developed by Ariadne Dx will be used to evaluate patient prognosis, 
determine the best course of treatment and care and monitor patients under treatment. The use of such tests to guide patient care 
has recently been referred to as "personalized medicine" and the demand for these tests is on the rise and is being driven by patients, 
clinicians and payors as a mechanism to improve health outcomes.  

The global biomarkers market for molecular diagnostics applications is expected to reach $5.2 billion by the end of 2012, and a 
compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.5% is forecast over the next several years. Presently, oncology is the most active field 
for disease biomarker research and development as well as market uptake. The major drivers in the oncology market are the severity 
of disease, the horrible side-effects of current cancer therapies and the costs of treatments. Research and development are also 
enhanced by the availability of biopsy and surgically excised tissue and because pharma and biotech companies are highly active in 
cancer drug discovery. Other disease areas are beginning to catch up to oncology in this regard, especially in cardiovascular and 
neurological disease. Ariadne Dx's flagship program is in cancer and it is pioneering the application of personalized medicine to 
neuromuscular and neurodegenerative disease.

##Cancers

##Colorector Spectra

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in both men and women. Each year, there are an estimated one million newly 
diagnosed cases of CRC worldwide. Approximately half of all patients with CRC will develop metastases and the majority of these patients 
will die from the cancer. About 143,460 new cases and 51,690 deaths from CRC are expected in 2012 in the U.S. 

The first product in development is a CDx test for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).  Current treatment regimens for mCRC include 
the use of two molecularly targeted agents, Erbitux&trade; and Vectibix&trade;.  Both of these FDA-approved drugs are targeted at the epidermal 
growth factor receptor (EGFR) and already require the use of a CDx test to determine the mutation status of KRAS.  Individuals whose c
ancers express a mutated form of KRAS are unlikely to benefit from EGFR-targeted therapy. However, the majority (55-60%) of those patients 
with wild type (normal) KRAS genes still do not respond to EGFR-targeted therapy. The product to be developed is a predictive test for 
mCRC pateint response to anti-EFGR drugs (mCRC-strat&trade; based on a panel of biomarkers. This test uses a proprietary series of biomarkers 
first identified using the Company's unique integrated bioinformatics approach. The mCRC-strat&trade; test will consist of panel of no more than 

10 predictive biomarkers from the fifteen promising candidates. The mCRC-strat&trade; is a novel predictive test for mCRC (WT KRAS) patient 
stratification for the discrimination of responders to anti-EGFR drugs (cetuximab and panitumumab) from non-responders. This test will 
significantly reduce the number of unnecessary and ineffective anti-EGFR treatments. Thus, the mCRC-strat&trade; test will enhance the efficiency 
of standard patient care and also greatly improve the overall outcome in patients.  

The mCRC-strat is not intended to screen for or diagnose cancer.  Its use is intended as an adjunct to other diagnostic factors currently 
used to select suitable patients for treatment with anti-EGFR therapies, based on the patients biomarker status. The mCRC-strat patients 
biomarker panel status will be considered by a Clinician, alongside other disease factors to make a therapy decision. No treatment decision 
for cancer patients should be based on the mCRC-strat result alone. This assay is intended for in vitro diagnostic use.

##Neuromuscular and neurodegenerative disease

Over the last several years, pharmaceutical companies have shown significant interest in conducting groundbreaking research and development 
for effective treatment agents for neuromuscular (NMD) and neurodegenerative disease (NDD). In the area of orphan drugs (products that treat 
rare diseases), the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products of the European Medicines Agency recently issued 111 positive opinions for orphan
designation. Also, 97 orphan designations have been granted by the Commission and five orphan drug products received marketing authorization 
in 2011. The EMA issued its first positive opinion specifically for a pediatric marketing authorization and also developed a process that would 
make prevalence figures for rare disease products transparent.

Despite some progress, novel therapeutic development in rare disorders including NMD and NDD is complicated not only because of the relatively 
low number of patients available for clinical trials but due to critical challenges regarding identification and development of sensitive and 
reliable outcome measures to adequately power smaller clinical trials. In addition, clinical trials in rare disorders face significant hurdles 
because of the limited understanding of natural history, difficulties in the selection of appropriate outcome measures, study design and 
complicated statistical considerations posed by small sample size. For these reasons, regulatory authorities such as the EMA and the FDA are 
often more willing to consider surrogate biomarkers as the primary endpoint in rare disorders, particularly in Phase II dose-ranging studies 
involving a limited numbers of patients. As such, the identification of sensitive and reliable biomarkers becomes a high priority for facilitating 
the evaluation of emerging therapies in drug trials and regulatory approval in NMD and NDD. Thus, the use of biomarkers for the diagnosis, 
prognosis, and monitoring of NMD/NDD as well as to guide the choice of therapeutic regimens is predicted to be one of the leading priorities 
in clinical practice. 

##Biomarkers Discovery for Rare NMD and NDD

Ariadne Dx is a member of two European Union funded Consortia that are targeted towards the development of biomarkers for NMD and NDD. The 
first consortium, Bio-NMD, is primarily focused on Duchenne and Becker's muscular dystrophies (DMD, BMD). The second consortium, NEUROMICS, 
is targeting 10 rare disease areas that comprise more than 15 NMD/NDDs.  These consortia, supply the Company with a distinct advantage in 
developing biomarkers for this disease area; specifically, the supply and analysis of bio-specimens from a much larger number of patients 
with these diseases than would be otherwise available. For both consortia, the Company is supplying all of the bio-informatic support and 
as one of the only commercial entities involved in the consortia, retains the rights to develop and market tests based on the findings. 

##Bioinformatics Services

The Company offers its services in integrated bioinformatics marker discovery to other entities on a contract basis. Contract services are 
expected to serve as a short-term source of revenue for the Company over the next two years. Ariadne Dx tailors its offerings for each client 
and services include biomarker discover, assay development, assay validation and clinical studies.
