##BIRD award

Ariadne Diagnostics (Ariadne-Dx) received the prestigious Binational Industrial Research and Development (BIRD) a 
$900,000 grant for a joint project between Ariadne-Dx and BioMarCare Ltd., an Israel partner. The companies intend 
to develop a panel of biological markers ("bio-markers") that will predict response or lack of response to drugs based 
on inhibitors of the EGF receptor, which is an active receptor on the cell wall. Drugs tested will include drugs such 
as cetuximab for metastatic colon cancer patients.
